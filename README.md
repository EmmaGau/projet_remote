## Segment Anything Model

## S1S2-Water dataset

The S1S2-Water dataset is a global reference dataset for training, validation and testing of convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of surface water bodies in publicly available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The dataset consists of 65 triplets of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images with quality checked binary water mask. Samples are drawn globally on the basis of the Sentinel-2 tile-grid (100 x 100 km) under consideration of pre-dominant landcover and availability of water bodies. Each sample is complemented with metadata and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster from the Copernicus DEM.
